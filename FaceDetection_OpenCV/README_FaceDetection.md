Steps for Face Detection in C++ Using Haar Cascade Classifier

1. Setup Environment in GitHub Codespaces:
- Open the repository in GitHub Codespaces and install necessary OpenCV dependencies.

2. Download Haar Cascade XML File:
- Download the pre-trained Haar Cascade XML file for face detection from the OpenCV repository or use a direct download command.

3. Write C++ Code for Face Detection:
- Include OpenCV headers in your C++ program.
- Load the Haar Cascade model for face detection.

4. Create a Makefile:
- Create a Makefile to simplify the process of compiling your C++ code.
- The Makefile defines the compiler, the necessary flags to link OpenCV libraries, and the files to compile.

5. Read the Input Image:
- Load the image where faces need to be detected.

6. Convert the Image to Grayscale:
- Convert the input image to grayscale for better detection performance.

7. Detect Faces:
- Use OpenCV's CascadeClassifier to detect faces in the grayscale image.

8. Draw Rectangles Around Detected Faces:
- For each detected face, draw a rectangle around it in the image.

9. Display or Save the Output Image:
- Save the processed image with detected faces or display it (locally).

10. Compile the C++ Code Using Makefile:
- Use the Makefile to compile the code and run the executable. 
-The Makefile handles compiling the code with the correct OpenCV libraries and dependencies and also runs the compiled executable to detect faces in the input image.

12. Push the Code and Results to GitHub:
- Stage, commit, and push all changes to the repository.
